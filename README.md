# Minesweeper

This assignment helped to solidify use of fetch in order to perform POST requests and restful APIs and REACT life-cycle.

Our task was to recreate a version of Minesweeper,the classic game that requires a player to strategically "sweep" for unknown mines. In creating the game board for this project, we utilized the two-dimensional or nested arrays as our rows and columns linked to an onChange event that revealed the second half of the game board.

While this project uses multiple fetch request, it could have been done with using axios post requests to the API as well.
This could also be refactored to include hooks in place of state.

//refactor :
add Axios
add hooks
rewrite reset button
add win or lost message
add difficulty menu dropdown
